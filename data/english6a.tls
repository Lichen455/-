This activity took place in the local park last Saturday morning, with over 50 volunteers from our class.\nDuring the activity, we cleaned up the park and planted some flowers and trees. We also helped some elderly people who were exercising in the park by providing them with water and towels. It was hard work, but we all enjoyed doing something for our community.\nAs for our feelings, we were all very proud of what we had accomplished. We realized that even small efforts can make a big difference. The smiles on the faces of the people we helped made us feel warm and happy. We also felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from doing something positive for the community.\nOverall, the volunteer activity was a great success. It not only helped improve our local environment, but also gave us a chance to learn the value of teamwork and the importance of helping others.
